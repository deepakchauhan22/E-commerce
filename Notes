provider connected react and redux
we include the jsx inside provider tag


store holds whole state tree of your application

connect connect our store to compoents




create file store.js 

Creating two folders:
1.1 Components
2. Redux

Inside redux create 3 folders;

actions
reducers
constant


first we create actions  folder :
example: productActions.js
actiontypes.js 


then we create Reducers folder:

inside this we create:
index.js folder (here we combine all reducers)
productReducer,js here we make reducers giving iniral state and action
then write switch cases inside them for diffrent action types

then we create store file
import reducrs and pss inital state and reducers

then we add redux to react using provider

into index.js or app.js
